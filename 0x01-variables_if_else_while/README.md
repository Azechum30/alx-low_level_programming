## C VARIABLES, IF, ELSE IF & WHILE LOOPS

This project talks about variables, branching and loops.

* Variables are simply a place in memory for storing data.

* Branching in programming is very important as it allow the programmer to control the flow of the program. Without branching or control flows, all programs will execute in the same manner. 
    > Branching is achieved through the use of conditional statements such as;
        * if statements - executes a block of code when a given condition 
	  evaluates to true
	* else statements - executes a block of code when all other conditions 
	  evaluates to false
	* else if statements - checks a new condition after the condition in an 
	  if statement evaluates to false.

* Loops - Loops are used to execute blocks of code repeatedly until particular condition is met. There three types of looping contructs in C. This are;
        * While loop - executes a block of code until a particular condition is
	  met.
	* For loop - Use for iterating over  list or arrays
	* Do while loop - executes block of code first before checking a certain
	  condition.
